# OneHaven Terms (Early Draft)

## 1) Not legal advice
OneHaven provides **operational intelligence** based on:
- public rules and datasets
- jurisdiction rules entered/stored in the system
- historical outcomes recorded in the system
- user-provided inputs (comps, inspection results)

OneHaven does **not** provide legal advice.
You are responsible for compliance, licensing, inspections, and leasing.

## 2) Data accuracy
External sources (e.g., RentCast, HUD) may be incorrect, delayed, or incomplete.
You must verify critical figures before executing a deal.

## 3) Decision outputs
System outputs (“PASS/REVIEW/REJECT”) are guidance signals based on your inputs.
They are not guarantees of rent, tenant placement, inspection outcomes, or profitability.

## 4) Liability limitation
Use at your own risk. Liability is limited to the amount paid in the last billing period (if any).

## 5) Early access reality
Features may change rapidly. Data models may evolve. Migrations may be required.
