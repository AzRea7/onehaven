# OneHaven Pricing (Early Access)

This product is for **Section 8 operators** (1–10 properties) in **Detroit / Wayne / Oakland County**.
It is not for nationwide landlords (yet), not for realtors, and not for wholesalers.

## Tiers (simple + defensible)
- **$29/mo** — 1–3 properties (solo starter)
- **$59/mo** — up to 10 properties (serious starter portfolio)
- **$99/mo** — serious operators (more volume, heavier compliance analytics)

## What you’re paying for (the moat)
- Rent ceiling explainability (FMR + comps)
- Jurisdiction friction scoring (time kills deals)
- Compliance checklist + failure analytics loop

## What is not included (yet)
- MLS automation
- Full ingestion scale + auto rejection rules
- Predictive inspection failures (Phase 6)
