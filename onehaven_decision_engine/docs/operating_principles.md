# OneHaven Operating Principles (Operating Truth)

This document is the internal constitution of the system.
Every feature, score, workflow, and automation MUST align with these principles.

## 1) Michigan is landlord-friendly only if compliant
Michigan can be investor-friendly in practice, but only if the operator is compliant.
Non-compliance is not a “minor issue”; it is a hard risk multiplier that can kill deals via:
- licensing delays
- failed inspections / reinspections
- registration friction
- delayed rent flow

## 2) Rent is constrained by reality, not optimism
Rent is constrained by three forces:

### A) HUD FMR (Fair Market Rent)
FMR is a ceiling reference, not a promise.

### B) Rent Reasonableness (local comps)
If local rent reasonableness comps are lower than FMR, comps win.

### C) Unit condition (inspection readiness)
A unit that cannot pass inspection does not produce rent.
Condition can also reduce achievable rent or extend time-to-rent.

## 3) Inspection is deterministic
Inspection outcomes are not “random”.
They are predictable from:
- property age (e.g., pre-1978 paint rules)
- known HQS fail patterns (GFCI, handrails, leaks, windows, etc.)
- city/inspector strictness
- rehab scope quality

Therefore:
- we generate checklists BEFORE inspection
- we track failures to build statistical certainty over time

## 4) Time kills deals
Delays are not neutral. They destroy IRR and can destroy the deal entirely.
Key delay drivers:
- licensing + registration processing time
- inspection scheduling time
- reinspections
- tenant waitlist depth / status

Time risk must be represented as:
- friction scoring (jurisdiction multiplier)
- reasons/explainability in outputs

## 5) Compliance friction is a cost, not an annoyance
Compliance is not “paperwork”.
It is a measurable cost:
- admin labor
- fees
- rework
- time-to-rent delay
- reinvestment into rehabs that should have been done upfront

The system must:
- model friction explicitly (jurisdiction rules)
- apply friction to deal score
- explain friction in results

## 6) The system must be explainable
A deal output must never feel mysterious.

For rent we must be able to answer:
- Which FMR was used?
- Which comps were used?
- What constraint capped rent?
- What final rent was used for underwriting?

For compliance we must be able to answer:
- What checklist was generated?
- Which items apply and why?
- What tends to fail in this jurisdiction?

## 7) “One screen truth” is the product promise
The property view must answer:
- Is this deal alive?
- What blocks rent?
- When does money flow?
- How risky is this city?
- What should I do next?
